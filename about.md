Welcome to my online portfolio

As a passionate and creative individual, I thrive on collaborative teamwork. My educational background is diverse, including a degree in Mechatronics engineering, with minors in Commerce and Economics, and experience in startup and sales. I've also earned a master's degree in Human Factors, and have gained extensive experience in UX and product design, with previous short stints with BlackBerry, HydroOne, and Google For Entrepreneurship.  
My professional goal is to specialize in the emerging field of how design attributions affect cognitive abilities, specifically in the areas of sports psychology, consumer technology, and human behaviour and development. I am also an avid cyclist and cycling coach at the University of Waterloo. And sometimes I do musicals on stage!
