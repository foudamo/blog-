Experienced Product Leader with 6+ years driving agile product development, UX/UI design, and platform management. Expert in integrating analytics, AI-driven solutions, and agile methodologies, consistently achieving significant productivity gains (up to 3x) with previous stints with Government of Canada, BlackBerry, HydroOne, and Google For Entrepreneurship. Background in Systems Engineering complemented by expertise in Human Factors, Cognitive Science, Commerce, and Economics.

Currently, with the United Nations helping build up [Quality of Life Initative](qolimpact.org), and by night building up [CivicTech Waterloo Region](civictechwr.org). My passion is in how design attributions affect cognitive abilities, specifically in the areas of sports psychology, consumer technology, and human behaviour and development. I am also an avid cyclist and cycling instructor at the University of Waterloo. And sometimes I do musicals on stage!
