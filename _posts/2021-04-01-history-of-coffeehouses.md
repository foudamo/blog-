# The History of Coffeehouses (Coffeeshops) and The Cultural Traits they Left Behind

*Originally posted at [Mohamed Fouda - History of Coffee Houses](https://sites.google.com/view/mohamed-fouda/archived-projects-research/history-of-coffee-houses)*

## Background - Why Coffee?
It is fascinating to me to see different designs of coffeeshops in Cairo (Egypt), for example a modern Starbucks right beside an old traditional Cairo coffeeshop. It mirrored my own internal clash as a son (immigrant) of two countries, with two contrasting history, cultures, and designs which I always wanted to point at and scream.
This research or map was an opportunity for me to unpack what I wanted to scream, exploring all the similarities and differences in the design of coffeeshops.
