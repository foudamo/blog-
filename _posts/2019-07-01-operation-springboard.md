## Project Overview
Marginalized youth are often caught up in between cracks for no fault of theirs but lack of knowledge. Working with Operation Springboard, we designed and built systems and curriculums to offer help in terms of courses such as "financial literacy" and "driving under influence".

- Designed and developed multiple educational systems, to work with marginalized youth in Scarborough, ON
- Designed educational curriculums with educators, seeking users for user testing, supporting multiple teams of developers and designers at once, and travelling to coordinate between teams in-between cities
- Designed an overview systematic process, for taking an idea all the way to delivery to the government's ministry owning the products
