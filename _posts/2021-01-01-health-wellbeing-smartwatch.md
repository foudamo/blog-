# Design of a Wellbeing-focused Smartwatch for the Average Consumer

*Originally posted at [Mohamed Fouda - Health & Wellbeing Smartwatch](https://sites.google.com/view/mohamed-fouda/experience/health-wellbeing-smartwatch)*

## Project Overview
Research shows that the majority of smartwatches get abandoned after 1-2 years due to users not finding "real" benefits from using them. In this project, we tried to redesign the smartwatch around useful habits for the consumer.

**Timeline:** Jan 2021 - Apr 2021
