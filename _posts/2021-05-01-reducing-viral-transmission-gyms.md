# A Review of Systematic Ways of Reducing Viral Transmission in Public Gyms

## Abstract
This report summarizes a design sprint that was done throughout 9 weeks. The report will go through the above stated problem, identified stakeholders, brainstormed solutions, the built prototype, conducted user testing and user interviews, and finally a discussion of the findings and next steps (if the project were continued). Throughout the 9 weeks sprint, the project followed the process outlined in Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days, under the supervision of Dr. John Zelek. The chosen theme that inspired the project problem was how to return safely from COVID-19 in an indoor-gym environment. The findings revealed complex bottlenecks and loopholes in the systems of gyms (especially at the University of Waterloo) that cause the capacity to run at lower than government restrictions allow, as well as many other inefficiencies. We present our suggestions and recommendations at the end of the report.
