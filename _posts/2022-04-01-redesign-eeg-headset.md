# Imagining a Consumer-targeted EEG Headset

*Originally posted at [Mohamed Fouda - Redesign EEG Headset](https://sites.google.com/view/mohamed-fouda/experience/redesign-eeg-headset)*

## Project Overview
Majority of EEG headsets currently are designed and engineered for researchers. In this project, we tried to redesign it as a consumer product. The targeted consumer in this case: Locked-in Syndrome Patients.

## Process
- **Background research:** Defined the human factors and restrictions/boundaries in terms of technology (sensors), head-location, and other technical boundaries.
- **Success criteria:** Defined "success" criteria to measure against (which were: fit comfort, ease of maintenance, friendliness “cool” factor, cleanliness for long wear). Created moodboards and assessments of what we define as successful examples/products.
- **Ideation & Prototyping:** Illustrated and brainstormed different ideas of the product solution, as well as built physical prototypes. Followed by user testing and interviewing, plus iterating on prototype.
- **Storytelling:** Directed a video of prototypes and illustrations, implementing storytelling techniques to explain the process, and the features/benefits. Implemented the story into an in-person presentation-format.
