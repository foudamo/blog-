## Project Overview
This is a complete cycle of a product from concept to final prototype, with a startup built around it employing tens of people and evaluated at $1M CAD.

- Raised north of $50k in funding from friends and family
- Grew the startup to a $1M evaluation
- Went through the process of hiring/laying-off 15+ people, and on average managed a team of 3â€“10 people
- Designed and developed 2 products from idea to final products, while market-testing countless potential pivots
- Designed boards & PCBs, conducted hundreds of user interviews, fabricated and tested dozens of prototypes, travelled to overseas fabrication houses, reached out to vendors, and hired and managed contractors & suppliers
