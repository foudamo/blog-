There are 4 things to remember
Sunlight
Loves the sun! Needs at least 6 hours or more of daily sunlight
Soil
Grows better in moist soil, but can also tolerate wet soil. Remember to put it in a well-drained potting mix soil
Temperature
Comfortable in indoor room temperature anywhere between 13 and 21 Celsius (for those of you across the border, that’s 55 and 70 Fahrenheit)
Water
Loves drinking lots of water! Needs to be watered thoroughly every 2–4 days. So make sure you keep it in moist soil all the time
