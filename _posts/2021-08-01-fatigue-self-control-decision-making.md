## Abstract
Individuals often fail to achieve their set personal objectives or make less than optimal choices due to their inability to follow through on their initial plans. This can be explained using the time inconsistency theory where individuals initially choose larger later (LL) but ultimately settle for smaller sooner (SS) when the decision time becomes imminent. In most cases, individuals often make impulsive emotional choices to reach a compromise to settle the urge. This imminent choice is often not optimal and would require some resolve to overcome the urge. We tested the effect of fatigue and time pressure on self-control to understand how these factors affect an individual’s ability to reach their goals. We used Hoch & Loewenstein’s economic-psychological framework which includes emotional and rational forces to explain the effects of fatigue and time pressure on self-control. In supporting our hypothesis, our experimental results will show that increase in willpower and decrease in desires are required to manage fatigue and time pressure respectively to maintain self-control.
