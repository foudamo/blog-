## Project Overview
As we move towards more immersive digital workspaces and working from home, we explored how the design of virtual office workspaces could affect your creativity and focus. Specifically, we built two different workspaces that are classified as "minimalist" and "maximalist" workspaces, and recruited users to see how it affected their moods.
