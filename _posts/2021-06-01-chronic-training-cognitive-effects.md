## Abstract
The overview of this research was to look at the relationship between mental health (more specifically, anxiety) & methodical (also known as chronic) training. The focus was on the positive effects usually gained from improving athletic performance of the individual (usually manifested in feeling more confident and less worry/stress), and/or improving their cognitive abilities in performing over time. The question asked in this paper was whether a weekly or monthly training schedule/plan can be utilized in the environments of work or studying, to get similar results as to what chronic training does for a marathon athlete.
