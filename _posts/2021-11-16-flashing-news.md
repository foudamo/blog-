I think this text could be a reason for conflict in the newsroom. When your business model is centered around “Breaking” news, live, and local, your news would be whatever “sells”, whatever makes you money (especially when your main goal as a for profit company is to make your owner or shareholders profit all the time). So news around “minority violence” or “celebrity stalking” would be frequent, because it’s simply what sells.

So a “Muslim terrorist” or a “Mexican rapist” or “black shooter” would be your go to titles, even if you wouldn’t call them that if a “white” person does it (it simply doesn’t sell as much). Perhaps that business model should change? How about “most accurate news” or “most honest news”? Also, how about changing the understanding of “profit? — From just a return on investment in terms of money, there should be other forms of profit — Like happiness? Trust? Giving back? Environment?
